# Image Description
Employees working in the Knowledge Commons Service Desk can accept customer
hardware for repairs and maintenance. In order for a customer to drop off
any item for repair, they must agree to terms approved by Penn State
University's legal department to mitigate risk.

Any action that an employee takes is recorded in the waiver, and upon final
resolution the waiver is submitted to JIRA for final storage and metrics
tracking.

The waiver itself consists of two parts, an Android application that
validates the customer's account and a Drupal module that parses the data and
allows employees to track their work performed. Finally, once the hardware is
returned to the user, the Drupal module stores the data into a JIRA instance.

This image represents a manager's view of a single waiver submission.



# George's Contribution
The original Android application and Drupal module were produced by another
staff member.

After the staff member's departure from the unit, I updated the Android
application with improved security by using HTTPS to send and receive data,
as it had been using HTTP before.

For the Drupal module, my primary contributions were identifying and
eliminating hundreds of lines of unused code, adding code commentary for
future developers, and clearing up thousands of errors caused by not adhering
to PHP_STRICT standards. Finally, I updated the code to more closely adhere
to PHP coding standards (PSR-1 and PSR-2) so that future developers would
have an easier time understanding the code.
