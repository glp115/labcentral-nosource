# LabCentral (No Source Included)
LabCentral is a series of Drupal 6 (and, later, Drupal 7) modules built by several developers for use by ITS Student Services, a division of the ITS Service Desk at Pennsylvania State University between 2008 and 2015.

It's primary functionality is employee management, in conjunction with Labman, a custom payroll-tracking and chat solution created by Pennsylvania State University. LabCentral supports interfaces with various 3rd party services including (but not limited to) ServiceNow, JIRA and Penn State's own classroom scheduling service.

# Core functionality
- Integrating Penn State's Account Management system into Drupal, controlling access to pages and restricting access dependent upon the account's status.
- Tracking employees from prospective hires through final termination.
- Managing internal communications between management and employees, including automatically generating and requesting explanations for timeclock anomalies.
- Maintaining a report of all manager and employee interactions and recorded actions taken during a shift, from date of hire through termination.
- Integrating with Google Maps to provide geographic maps in which employees can see and respond to technical support requests or incidents.
- Integrating with JIRA and ServiceNow to receive and send service requests and report and track incidents.
- Integrating with a custom Android application to receive and track personal user hardware turned in for repairs.
- Permitting schedule generation and a round-robin, seniority-based system for employees to select shifts that worked around their class schedule.
