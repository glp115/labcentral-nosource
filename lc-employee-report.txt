# Image Description
The Employee Report provides a single-page displaying all timeclock
anomalies, all communication requests, all training and other automated (or
manually entered) actions taken by an employee or manager.

This report provides a complete history of an employee's performance from
hire to termination, including color-coded statuses for important positive or
negative interactions (if any). Restricted notices (if any) are only shown to
individuals with the appropriate permissions to view them. This list would
also include training quiz results, evaluations by supervisors and so forth.

This report also interfaces with Google Charts API (where available) to show 
an employee's evaluation trend over time. An example is provided here.



# George's Contribution
I assisted with defining the API that was used by the employment report to
receive data from other modules (such as communications, hardware waivers,
payroll adjustments, training completion and so forth). I also converted the
existing Drupal 6 module to Drupal 7's specifications, including rewriting
all queries to rely on PDO.

I added the initial integration between the evaluation module and Google
Charts API, permitting a manager to see how an employee's evaluation has
improved over time.
