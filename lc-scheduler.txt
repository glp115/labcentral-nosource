# Image Description
Employees in LabCentral utilize a custom scheduling module to schedule weekly
shifts.

This image displays one location of many that student staff can work. Red
blocks of time indicate occupied shifts, while green blocks of time indicate
unoccupied shifts.

This image represents the view that management sees, including all occupied
and unoccupied shifts. Students have an additional view showing only the
shifts they elected to work.



# George's Contribution
This was one of the first portions of LabCentral that I worked on in Drupal 6,
assisting with the design and implementation of the scheduler, as well as
converting the scheduler to function in Drupal 7 and use PDO to access the
database.

Although not readily visible in this image, I also wrote several checks to
identify and prevent student employees from colluding or otherwise "holding"
shifts for friends. One issue that our unit faced involved students with high
seniority "holding" shifts for their friends, or harassing employees that they
did not like. While some of these interactions were dealt with through
disciplinary action, I wrote the anti-collusion functionality as an additional
layer of protection to ensure employees treated one-another fairly.

Finally, I added functionality to check student employee's schedules to
ensure that they did not double-book themselves with simultaneous shifts.
This functionality was included but partially ineffective in the initial
release of the scheduler.
